# 🚀 Autonomous Multi-Agent AI Software Development Team

An AI-powered system that simulates a **real-world software development team** using multiple specialized agents (Planner, Developer, Reviewer, QA, and Documentation).

This project demonstrates how **LLMs can collaborate as autonomous agents** to transform a feature request into production-ready artifacts — including code, tests, and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Given a simple feature request, the system automatically:

1. 📋 Breaks it into development tasks (Planner Agent)  
2. 💻 Generates code (Developer Agent)  
3. 🔍 Reviews code for issues (Reviewer Agent)  
4. 🧪 Creates test cases (QA Agent)  
5. 📚 Generates documentation (Docs Agent)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd multi-agent-development-team
````

---

### 2. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
myvenv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## 📡 API Usage

### Endpoint

```
POST /build-feature
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "request": "Build a FastAPI todo API with CRUD endpoints"
}
```

---

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "tasks": "1. Define Todo model...\n2. Create FastAPI app...",
  "code": "from fastapi import FastAPI ...",
  "review": {
    "bugs": [],
    "performance_issues": [],
    "security_issues": [],
    "best_practices": []
  },
  "tests": "def test_create_todo(): ...",
  "documentation": "API endpoints:\n- GET /todos\n..."
}
```

## 🧩 Key Features

* 🤖 Multi-agent collaboration (Planner, Developer, Reviewer, QA, Docs)
* 🧠 LLM-powered reasoning for each development stage
* 📦 End-to-end automation from idea → code → tests → docs
* 🔍 Structured code review output (JSON)
* ⚡ FastAPI-based scalable backend

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* LLM outputs may occasionally be inconsistent or verbose
* Requires prompt tuning for better code quality
* No persistent memory between agents (yet)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add vector memory (RAG) for context awareness
* Integrate with GitHub PR automation
* Add UI dashboard for agent workflow
* Improve code generation reliability
* Add execution sandbox for generated code

---

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

This project showcases:

* Real-world AI system design (not just API calls)
* Understanding of multi-agent orchestration
* Practical use of LLMs in software engineering workflows
* Strong backend engineering with FastAPI + modular design
